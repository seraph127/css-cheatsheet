Self-documenting css tutorial/sample website

There's no contribution to the good of the world here, except my own. I am following a YouTube video tutorial called
"CSS Crash Course For Absolute Beginners" by Traversy Media. I'm doing it using VS Code and uploading it to a Git
Repo in order to learn to use these tools along with learning the basics of web programming.
